In a market dominated by established competitors with hundreds of reviews, they needed to establish credibility fast—or risk staying invisible.</p>

      <h2 class="blogheading2">The Client &amp; The Challenge</h2>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">Who They Are</h3>
      <p class="p">Finish Line Roofing &amp; Exteriors is a new roofing company serving the Indianapolis area. Despite quality work and proper certifications, they were practically invisible online with only a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61576019060081" target="_blank" class="link">Facebook page</a> to their name. They came to me wanting a website in order to drive more leads online but also to build up credibility for their business.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">The Problem</h3>
      <ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled">
        <li class="p">The company was facing a few problems. Here is the breakdown of each problem and what it meant for their business:</li>
        <li class="p">No digital footprint: No website, Google Business Profile, or directory listings to be found by potential customers</li>
        <li class="p">Zero social proof: No reviews, testimonials, or project portfolio to build trust with homeowners</li>
        <li class="p">Low discoverability: In a competitive market where homeowners search online first, being invisible online makes it hard for them to compete with other companies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="blogsection">
    <div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container w-clearfix w-container">
      <h2 class="blogheading2">The Approach</h2>
      <p class="p">Rather than just building a &quot;brochure site,&quot; the goal was to create a marketing foundation that would position Finish Line as a credible local authority and generate inbound leads organically. This was done through optimizing the site for SEO, providing real, genuine and helpful content on the site and making sure the page load speeds were very fast. <br><br>This is how I approached their website.</p><img src="../images/Group-30.avif" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 727.984375px, 939.984375px" srcset="../images/Group-30-p-500.avif 500w, ../images/Group-30-p-800.avif 800w, ../images/Group-30-p-1080.avif 1080w, ../images/Group-30.avif 1980w" alt="" class="strategyimg">
      <h3 class="blogheading3">Discovery &amp; Research</h3>
      <p class="p">I analyzed three top-ranking local competitors to identify what was working in the Indianapolis roofing market and where gaps existed. This revealed opportunities in site speed, local targeting, and content structure that we could exploit.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">SEO Foundation With a Site Structure Plan</h3>
      <p class="p">Through keyword research, I identified the exact search phrases homeowners use like &quot;roof replacement Indianapolis&quot; and &quot;roof leak repair near me.&quot; The site architecture was built around these terms, with dedicated service and location pages that signal relevance to both Google and potential customers. By creating all of these pages, we set up a solid foundation for Finish Line Roofing and Exteriors to build their business on.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">Design &amp; User Experience</h3>
      <p class="p">I designed a conversion-focused homepage that prioritized clarity over flash. Every element serves a purpose: prominent &quot;Free Estimate&quot; CTAs, clear service navigation, and trust signals placed strategically throughout the user journey. This designed was delivered to Finish Line Roofing to review before beginning the work to develop the new website. They were kept up-to-date with each step in the process so that they could have their say on any necessary changes as they were being made instead of having to wait until the end.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">Technical Optimization</h3>
      <p class="p">The site was built for speed and performance, ensuring it loads faster than competitor sites. This improves both user experience and search rankings, a critical advantage when homeowners are comparing multiple roofers. By helping them stand out in this area, they had something that helped them build credibility even before they had the number of reviews needed to compete.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">The Solution</h3>
      <p class="p">I built a fast-loading, SEO-optimized website on Webflow that established immediate credibility even without reviews or an extensive portfolio. This website was setup in a way that Kyle could easily add new projects as his team completed them. Every paragraph and image was also easily updatable without needing me. This gives him full control over his website.</p>
      <h3 class="blogheading3">Key Features Delivered</h3>
      <ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled">
        <li class="p"><strong>Local SEO architecture:</strong> Individual pages for each service and location signal to Google that Finish Line serves specific Indianapolis neighborhoods. As they collect reviews from customers, this provides them a place to put the relevant reviews on these pages so that future customers can see what their neighbors are saying about Kyle and his team.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Performance optimization:</strong> Site loads faster than established competitors, scoring 90+ on Google PageSpeed. This prevents users from leaving the website (a high bounce rate) because the site is taking too long to load. This also gives Finish Line Roofing a boost in credibility by having a high performing website.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Trust signals:</strong> Prominently featured GAF certification, which allows Finish Line to offer extended warranties and builds immediate credibility. As they collect reviews, this combination will help to quickly build trust with their prospective customers.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Conversion pathways:</strong> &quot;Free Estimate&quot; forms and phone numbers visible throughout the site make it effortless for homeowners to reach out. One of the biggest mistakes that roofing contractors make is that their websites don&#x27;t make it easy for visitors to contact them. Finish Line Roofing won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Professional branding</strong><strong>:</strong> Consistent design and quality imagery present Finish Line Roofing as an established, trustworthy company.</li>
        <li class="p"><strong>Internal linking structure</strong><strong>: </strong>Strategic cross-linking between pages helps Google understand their services and service areas while improving user navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="blogheading3">Built For Long Term Growth</h3>
      <p class="p">Individual service pages for roof replacement, repair, and inspection define the common roofing services that Finish Line Roofing offers, but there are also pages for the exterior service and weather repair.  Finish Line Roofing wants to be known as a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for weather repair home exterior repairs while still emphasizing the roofing services. The site structure reflects this and helps them reach this goal.<br><br>By having optimized landing pages for each service and town, Finish Line Roofing and Exteriors could now run paid ad campaigns for these pages. Each page has a clear call-to-action so that users who land on those pages can reach out to them.<br><br>The content structure remains scalable, adding new pages is easy and helps &quot;future proof&quot; the website as the business expands, no matter how Finish Line Roofing might pivot in the future, the website can handle those changes with ease.</p>
